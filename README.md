## Instructions

> This is a very simple and basic game
> but trust me just because you could do it easily doesn't mean someone else can
> I have this protege who was given this task by someone and it took him days
> whereas I did it in 40 mins,
> so I uploaded this here just to show some people how it works and so they could try it out
> you can clone it and play, study the code, seriouly nothing serious
